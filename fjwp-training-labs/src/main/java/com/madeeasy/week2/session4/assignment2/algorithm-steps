Sure, here's a step-by-step explanation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in simple terms:

1. Start at the beginning of the array.
2. Compare the first two elements. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of elements (second and third) and compare them. Again, if the second element is greater than the third, swap them.
4. Repeat this process, moving one step to the right each time and comparing and swapping if necessary, until you reach the end of the array.
5. After the first pass, the largest element will have "bubbled up" to the end of the array.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining unsorted portion of the array (excluding the last element, which is already sorted).
7. Continue this process for each remaining unsorted element until the entire array is sorted.

In simple terms, Bubble Sort works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted, with the largest elements "bubbling up" to the end.








Sure, I'll explain each sorting algorithm step by step in simple terms and provide graphical representations where needed.

**Bubble Sort:**

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if
they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

1. Start with the first element in the list.
2. Compare it with the next element. If the first element is greater than the next one, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swapping process.
4. Continue this process until you reach the end of the list in the first pass. After the first pass, the largest element will
 "bubble up" to the end of the list.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the remaining unsorted elements (excluding the last one, which is already sorted).
6. Continue this process until no more swaps are needed. If no swaps occur in a pass, the list is sorted.

**Selection Sort:**

Selection Sort is another simple sorting algorithm. It sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays: one that is sorted and one that is unsorted.

1. Find the minimum element in the unsorted array.
2. Swap it with the first element of the unsorted array (putting it in its correct place in the sorted array).
3. Move the boundary between the sorted and unsorted subarrays one element to the right.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the entire array is sorted.

**Insertion Sort:**

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient
on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or Heap Sort but is efficient for small lists.

1. Start with the second element (assuming the first element is already sorted by itself).
2. Compare the second element with the first and swap them if necessary to put them in the correct order.
3. Move to the third element and insert it into its correct position among the first three elements.
4. Continue this process for all remaining elements, inserting each one into its correct place among the sorted elements.
5. At the end, you'll have a fully sorted array.

These are basic sorting algorithms that are easy to understand but may not be the most efficient for large datasets.
More advanced algorithms like Quick Sort and Merge Sort are typically used in practice for larger datasets due to their better performance.
